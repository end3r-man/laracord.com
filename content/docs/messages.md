Laracord's `Message` component provides a powerful fluent syntax to send Discord messages to users and channels.

## Basic Usage

When working in the context of Laracord, the `Message` component is almost always available using the `$this->message()` method.

In it's simplest form, message generally requires some form of content and a destination.

```php
$this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->send('channel-id');

$this
    ->message('Hello user!')
    ->sendTo('user-id');
```

This gives you a sensibly styled embed with the username and avatar of your bot.

To send a plain message without an embed, you may pass your content to the `->body()` method:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message()
    ->body('Hello world!');
```

## Direct Usage

When `$this->message()` is not available in your class, you can typically access and make `Message` directly:

```php
use Laracord\Discord\Message;

$message = Message::make()->content('Hello world!');
```

## Available Methods

- [Image](#content-image)
- [Timestamp](#content-timestamp)
- [Author](#content-author)
- [Fields](#content-fields)
- [Files](#content-files)
- [Buttons](#content-buttons)
  - [Link Button](#content-link-button)
  - [Interactions](#content-interactions)

### Title

Set the title of the embed:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->title('Example');
```

### Content

Set the content of the embed. This can be used instead of passing content to `message` directly:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message()
    ->content('Hello world!');
```

### Username

By default, this is the username of your bot application.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->username('Laracord');
```

### Avatar

By default, this is the avatar of your bot application.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->avatarUrl('...');
```

### TTS

This determines whether your message is a TTS message.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->tts(true);
```

### Color

By default, Laracord sends embeds using `->success()` which provides a green border color.

This can be overriden by passing a color in decimal directly to `->color()` or by using the other available color helper methods:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->color('3066993')
    ->success()
    ->error()
    ->warning()
    ->info();
```

### Footer

The embed footer can contain text as well as an icon.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->footerText('Sent by Laracord')
    ->footerUrl('...');
```

### Thumbnail

The thumbnail URL appears as a medium-sized image to the right of the embed.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->thumbnailUrl('...');
```

### Image

The image URL appears as a large-sized image inside of the embed.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->imageUrl('...');
```

### Timestamp

The timestamp appears at the bottom of the embed and is shown to the user in their local time.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->timestamp(now());
```

### Author

The embed author is shown at the top of the embed. By default, Laracord set's the `authorName` and `authorIcon` to the bot's username and avatar.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->authorName('Laracord')
    ->authorIcon('...')
    ->authorUrl('...');
```

### Fields

Fields consist of groups of data represented by a label and value. By default, they are inline with Discord showing up to 3 fields per line.

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->field('Field 1', 'Value 1')
    ->field('Field 2', 'Value 2');
```

To pass a group of fields, you can use the `->fields()` method:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->fields([
        'Field 1' => 'Value 1',
        'Field 2' => 'Value 2',
    ]);
```

To prevent a field from being inline, you can pass `inline: false` like so:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->field('Field 1', 'Value 1')
    ->field('Field 2', 'Value 2', inline: false);
```

You can also conditionally display a field:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->field('Field 1', 'Value 1')
    ->field('Field 2', 'Value 2', hidden: true);
```

### Files

Attaching a file to your message can be done using raw content or by passing a path:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->file('Lorem ipsum...', 'lorem.txt');

$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->filePath('path/to/file');
```

### Buttons

Buttons are shown at the bottom of your message and can consist of URL's or interactions. Laracord tries to make both easy to use.

#### Link Button

A button in it's simplest form would be a **link button** and consists of a simple label and URL value:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->button('Visit Laracord', 'https://laracord.com');
```

When working with a link button, you also have the option of passing an emoji:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->button('Visit Laracord', 'https://laracord.com', emoji: 'ðŸ’»');
```

When using a custom emoji from a server your bot is in, you will have to pass the emoji along with it's internal ID.

> #### Tip
>
> An easy way to obtain this as a string is to escape the emoji in a Discord chat message.
> `\:laracord:` would return `<:laracord:1204740745286656050>` containing the string needed.

Once you obtain the emoji ID, you can then pass it to `emoji` as a string:

```php
$message = $this
    ->message('Hello world!')
    ->button('Visit Laracord', 'https://laracord.com', emoji: ':laracord:1204740745286656050');
```

#### Interactions

Interactions allow you to have the bot respond or perform an action when a button is clicked. This can be achieved by passing an `Interaction` callback as the button's `value` instead of a string:

```php
use Discord\Parts\Interactions\Interaction;

$message = $this
    ->message('Say hello!')
    ->button('Hello', fn (Interaction $interaction) => $interaction->respondWithMessage(
        $this->message('Well hello to you!')->build(),
        ephemeral: true
    ), emoji: 'ðŸ‘‹');
```

In the example above, we respond to the interaction as well as set `ephemeral` to `true` to ensure the button can only be interacted with a single time.

> #### Note
>
> It is recommended to handle button interactions in commands using Laracord's interaction routing. See the [Interaction Persistence](/docs/interactions#content-message-interaction-persistence) documentation to learn more.

When working with buttons that resolve interactions, you also have the option of changing the [button style](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#button-object-button-styles).

The available options are `primary` (default), `secondary`, `success`, and `danger`:

```php
use Discord\Parts\Interactions\Interaction;

$message = $this
    ->message('Say hello!')
    ->button('Hello', fn (Interaction $interaction) => $interaction->respondWithMessage(
        $this->message('Well hello to you!')->build(),
        ephemeral: true
    ), emoji: 'ðŸ‘‹', style: 'success');
```
